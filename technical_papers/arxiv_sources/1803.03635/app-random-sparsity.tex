\section{Comparing Random Reinitialization and Random Sparsity}
\label{app:random}

In this Appendix, we aim to understand the relative performance of randomly reinitialized winning tickets and randomly sparse networks.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Networks found via iterative pruning with the original initializations (blue in Figure \ref{fig:random-app}).
\item Networks found via iterative pruning that are randomly reinitialized (orange in Figure \ref{fig:random-app}).
\item Random sparse subnetworks with the same number of parameters as those found via iterative pruning (green in Figure \ref{fig:random-app}).
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:random-app} shows this comparison for all of the major experiments in this paper. For the fully-connected Lenet
architecture for MNIST, we find that the randomly reinitialized networks outperform random sparsity. However, for all of the other,
convolutional networks studied in this paper, there is no significant difference in performance between the two. We hypothesize that
the fully-connected network for MNIST sees these benefits because only certain parts of the MNIST images contain useful information
for classification, meaning connections in some parts of the network will be more valuable than others. This is less true with
convolutions, which are not constrained to any one part of the input image.

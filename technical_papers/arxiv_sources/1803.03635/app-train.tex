\section{Training Accuracy for Lottery Ticket Experiments}
\label{app:train}

This Appendix accompanies Figure \ref{fig:rand_init} (the accuracy and early-stopping iterations of Lenet on MNIST from Section \ref{sec:fc}) and Figure \ref{fig:question-1} (the accuracy and early-stopping iterations of Conv-2, Conv-4, and Conv-6 in Section Section \ref{sec:conv}) in the main body of the paper.
Those figures show the iteration of early-stopping, the test accuracy at early-stopping, the training accuracy at early-stopping, and the test accuracy at the end
of the training process. However, we did not have space to include a graph of the training accuracy at the end of the training process, which we assert in the main body of the paper to be
100\% for all but the most heavily pruned networks. In this Appendix, we include those additional graphs in Figure \ref{fig:rand_init2} (corresponding to Figure \ref{fig:rand_init}) and Figure \ref{fig:question-12} (corresponding to Figure \ref{fig:question-1}). As we describe in the main body of the paper, training accuracy reaches 100\% in all cases
for all but the most heavily pruned networks. However, training accuracy remains at 100\% longer for winning tickets than for randomly reinitialized networks.

\caption{An example where REALM adapts to the updated knowledge corpus. The 
Wikipedia page ``Excellent Cadaver'' was added in 2019, so the model was not about to recover
the word when the knowledge corpus is outdated (2018). Interestingly, the same REALM model pre-trained on the 2018 corpus is able to retrieve the document in the updated corpus (2020) and generate the correct token, \nl {Lawrence}.}
